# Financial Factor Analysis and Asset Pricing Models

This repository hosts a comprehensive Python-based analysis framework focused on exploring financial factor models and asset pricing theories. Leveraging powerful statistical tools and financial data, the project aims to uncover insights into stock and fund performance, risk factors, and market dynamics

## Features

- **Factor Analysis: Time series analysis of market excess returns, SMB (Small Minus Big), and HML (High Minus Low) factors..
- **Annual Returns Conversion: Monthly return data are annualized to facilitate a more macroscopic view of financial trends..
- **Visualization: Plotting of factor returns over time and the relationship between risk and return, including the Capital Market Line (CML)..
- **Statistical Modeling: Utilization of CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) and Fama-French 3-Factor Model to estimate stock betas and predict expected returns.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling: Integration with datasets including stock and fund returns, market capitalization, and factor data to drive the analysis


### How to Use


- Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical computations
- Matplotlib: For generating insightful visualizations
- Statsmodels: For conducting robust statistical analyses and regression modeling
